    "## Hypothesis 1: Gender and Punishment Severity - Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "We tested whether female defendants received lighter punishments than male defendants across different crime types. We looked at three punishment categories: harsh (execution, whipping, hard labour), medium (imprisonment, fines), and lenient (pardon, respite).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Finding\n",
    "\n",
    "**Female defendants overwhelmingly received harsher punishments less often than male defendants.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In harsh punishments, males were punished severely in significantly more crime types than females. Looking across all crimes in the dataset, males received harsh punishments at higher rates in the vast majority of cases. The biggest gaps were in crimes like assault with intent (31% of males vs 0% of females), sodomy (27% vs 0%), and seditious libel (20% vs 0%).\n",
    "\n",
    "### What This Means\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though female defendants were more likely to be acquitted in the first place (found not guilty), the ones who were convicted still got off easier than men. This suggests gender bias worked in women's favour at sentencing - courts were lenient on female defendants even when they were found guilty.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The hypothesis is strongly supported: **female defendants received significantly lighter punishments than male defendants across most crime types.**\n",

    "### Hypothesis 2: Occupation Class, Theft Value, and Punishment Severity - FC\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Null Hypothesis (H₀):** There is no interaction between defendant occupation class and theft value in predicting punishment severity. Punishment severity increases uniformly with theft value regardless of the defendant's social class.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** Lower-class defendants receive increasingly harsh punishments as theft values increase, while upper-class defendants receive stable punishments regardless of theft value, demonstrating class-based bias in sentencing."

    "\n",
    "So, why Ordinal Regression? Well, punishment as a concept is ordered (some punishments are worse than others) and if we want to say \"x person received a worse punishment\", then we need to consider the data to be ordinal. This is what OLR (Ordinal Logistic Regression) is desgined for, it allows us to model how our factors like gender and occupation affect the likelihood of receiving a worse punishment on the ordinal scale. And, we don't have to assume each punishment has an equal distance between them (which they don't and I cannot imagine even trying to figure that out). Note that putting the punishment types on a scale of 0-5 does not assume magnitude, what Ordinal Regression does is that it estimates thresholds between categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no \"per unit\" punishment. Instead, we are asking ourselves what affects the odds that a case crosses from one punishment category to a higher one? Now, when doing most modelling, you make a Null model. This is a model where you only use the intercept and no predictors, and then you can compare your model to it to see if doing a model is even worth it. \n",
    "\n",
    "The thing is, OLR does not use a single intercept. As we explained, it uses a variety of thresholds that replace the intercept. So, if we tried to make a Null model, it would consist of only the thresholds between the categories. Which is awfully difficult to make coding software agree to make. Attempts to get around this issue failed, so we moved on from doing a comparison to a Null model in this particular case. \n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: We did not end up using the sub-ordinal scales, as we'd have to make a bunch more assumptions, and also it's hard to justify an ordinal rating between say: 6 month imprisonment or 3 month imprisonment vs death. It's adding unjustified linearity to our Ordinal Model that we do NOT need."
