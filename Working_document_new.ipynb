This pattern held consistently across specific crime types, with notable examples including murder (18.65% male vs 10.44% female) and robbery (24.70% male vs 7.95% female). This systematic leniency towards women suggests courts applied gendered assumptins about culpability and criminality. Whether due to percieved vulnerability, social expectations about female criminality, or other factors, the data clearly shows that being female offered a significant advantage in sentencing outcomes. The consistency of this pattern across different crime categories indicates this was not anomalous but rather a fundamental feature of how the Old Bailey administered justice during this period."

    "We can interpret from the model summary that class (occupation_code) is a significant predictor of punishment type, with the coefficient -0.4927 describing a reduction in punishment severity by around 0.5 (punishment is scaled between 1-5) for every increase in class (scaled 1-4). The p value is noted as 0.00 which describes it is significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking again at the p values, we can see that the value of the theft (noted in the model as variable name log_value) is also significant but has a much smaller effect (-0.068 / p value of 0.020) - surprisingly this shows that with a higher  value of theft there is a slight decrease in the severity of the punishment - so petty thefts get punished more harshly than major ones. \n",
    "\n",
    "The interaction we were actually searching for though: occupation_code:log_value does not have a significant p value (0.346) which can be interpretted to mean that the value of a thefts effect on punishment does not differ significantly by class. "

    "Here we can see very clearly that the higher class you are, the lower severity of punishment you are predicted to receive, but that otherwise the effect of the value of the theft is the same accross the board - highest penalties for lower value thefts and more leniency for higher value ones. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thinking about this within a historical contextualisation it may be interpretsble that higher value thefts are more likely to be repayable through fines (rated low [2] on the punishment scale) as they are likely to have result in financial gain, wheras low value thefts (food, clothes etc) are unlikely to be returnable, and more likely to be repeated (due to poverty or neccessity) and so somewhat illogically better punished harshly as a stronger deterent (a spinster who has stolen a bottle of gin won't keep stealing bottles of gin if she's dead).

For each of these we can see that there is less variation in lower value theft punishments but much higher variation in high value. There is also much less variation across low class and much higer variation as you get to upper class - this might be partially caused by the higher numbers of low class data points providing better averages and predicitons, and the low quantities of high class data points resulting in much greater variability.
