    "\n",
    "Common Law. Starting from the Magna Carta to its form in the modern day, it is the system in which past court decisions shape how laws are interpreted and applied over time, and is known for its flexibility and continuity. And that is an important word. Continuity.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the Old Bailey dataset, we can see this continuity play out in our CSV over 300 years worth of data. Britain is the birthplace of the Common Law, and exported it through influence and imperialism, and is arguably one of the countries most enduring and important global legacies. But with such a flexible system open to interpretation, how the law is applied under the grounds of Common Law can be controversial. The verdict of individual judges and juries can hold create influence, and thus their biases can hold greater weight, especially when first establishing precedence.\n",
    "\n",
    "And it is that bias we want to look at, the hypothesis we want to test. Does a defendant's gender or occupation affect the punishment they may receive at the Old Bailey court? Furthermore, does this change with time? As such, we can form the following Null and Alternative Hypothesis:\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Null Hypothesis (H₀):** Defendant gender and occupation cannot predict punishment type. These variables have no relationship with the punishment received.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** Defendant gender and occupation significantly predict punishment type, with certain occupations and female gender associated with more lenient punishments.\n"

For example, one issue we have is that the imprisonment length is non-numeric currently, as it was pulled via a regex function, so is currently in the form of strings. For example, \"2 years\". Another issue we have is that not every row has occupation as a viable piece of data. Only 20,000 rows have them. Which is, of course, still a lot of data. So, we are going to have to filter rows that have a punishment AND an associated occupation of the defendant.\n",

    "So, why Ordinal Regression? Well, punishment as a concept is ordered (some punishments are worse than others) and if we want to say \"x person received a worse punishment\", then we need to consider the data to be ordinal. This is what OLR (Ordinal Logistic Regression) is desgined for, it allows us to model how our factors like gender and occupation affect the likelihood of receiving a worse punishment on the ordinal scale. And, we don't have to assume each punishment has an equal distance between them (which they don't and I cannot imagine even trying to figure that out). Note that putting the punishment types on a scale of 0-5 does not assume magnitude, what Ordinal Regression does is that it estimates thresholds between categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no \"per unit\" punishment. Instead, we are asking ourselves what affects the odds that a case crosses from one punishment category to a higher one? Now, when doing most modelling, you make a Null model. This is a model where you only use the intercept and no predictors, and then you can compare your model to it to see if doing a model is even worth it. \n",
    "\n",
    "The thing is, OLR does not use a single intercept. As we explained, it uses a variety of thresholds that replace the intercept. So, if we tried to make a Null model, it would consist of only the thresholds between the categories. Which is awfully difficult to make coding software agree to make. Attempts to get around this issue failed, so we moved on from doing a comparison to a Null model in this particular case. \n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: We did not end up using the sub-ordinal scales, as we'd have to make a bunch more assumptions, and also it's hard to justify an ordinal rating between say: 6 month imprisonment or 3 month imprisonment vs death. It's adding unjustified linearity to our Ordinal Model that we do NOT need."
