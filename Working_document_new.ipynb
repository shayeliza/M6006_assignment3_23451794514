    "**Method:**\n",

    "We compared the proportion of male and female defendants who received harsh punishments, defined as: executed, drawnAndQuartered, burning, branding, hangingInChains, deathAndDissection, hardLabour, publicWhipping, privateWhipping, whipping, and pillory.\n",

    "- Male defendants: 13.48% received harsh punishment\n",
    "- Female defendants: 8.88% received harsh punishment\n",
    "- Difference: 4.60 percentage points\n",

    "\n",
    "Female defendants were significantly less likely to receive harsh physical punishments compared to male defendants. This represents a 4.60 percentage point difference, with females receiving harsh punishments at roughly two-thirds the rate of males. This suggests that courts applied more lenient sentencing practices to women overall. \n",
