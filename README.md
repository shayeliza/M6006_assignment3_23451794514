## Setup Instructions

**Working_document_new.ipynb** is the master notebook containing all analysis for this project.

**old_bailey_actual_final.csv** is stored as a zip file and must be extracted before use, as the actual CSV file is too large to store directly on GitHub.

Before running the notebook, ensure you have installed all required packages by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note: The cleaning and data processing section of the notebook has been commented out (marked with hashtags). These cells are included to demonstrate the XML cleaning and data processing steps we performed, which are an important part of the workflow. Do not run these cells, as doing so would overwrite the processed data and disrupt the rest of the analysis.
